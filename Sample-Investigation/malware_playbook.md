# 🛡️ Malware Incident Response Playbook

---

## 🧠 Overview

This playbook outlines the standard steps taken by the SOC team to identify, contain, and remediate malware discovered on a system.

---

## 🚨 Initial Detection

- Source: Log Watcher flagged unauthorized access
- Timeline analysis revealed:
  - Brute force login attempt
  - Successful root access
  - Suspicious use of `sudo`
- IP address: `10.0.0.66` (identified as hostile)

---

## 📋 Response Steps

1. **Isolate Host**
   - Disconnect affected system from the network
   - Prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration

2. **Collect Artifacts**
   - Preserve logs (`auth.log`, system logs)
   - Capture process list, network connections, running services
   - Save suspicious binaries (if found)

3. **Scan for Malware**
   - Run endpoint antivirus/EDR scan
   - Hash any unknown executables
   - Compare hashes to local or online threat intel

4. **Block Indicators**
   - Add malicious IP (`10.0.0.66`) to firewall blocklist
   - Add domains/hashes to EDR rules or proxy filter

5. **Remediate**
   - Remove malware or affected user account
   - Rotate credentials (especially root/admin)
   - Re-image if integrity is questionable

6. **Monitor & Review**
   - Watch for reinfection or related activity
   - Update detection rules based on attack path
